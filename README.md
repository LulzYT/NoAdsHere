## Attention
I'm currently working hard on rewriting o lot of NAH's generic planed code as this will allow me to support Regexes for all kinds of advertisement dynamically.
But as this takes quite a bit of time and planing, im sorry that i cant update the bot as frequently as i would like to. Once i have the heavy lifting done i will be updating the bot more regularly. So for now please note that the Wiki might be a bit outdated but feel free to join my server and ask me for help

### Currently working features:
 - Discord Invites
 - YouTube
 - Twitch

### Planed features:
 - Url Shorteners?
 - More Customization
 - Discord Bot Invite Links

Suggestions for new sites/services are always welcome!
 
# Getting Started Guide!
To start off do: `?nah Blocks Enable <Type>`.
Replace <Type> with the type of advertisement you want to block,  
I think most of you want to prevent Discord Invites. To do this you would type: 
`?nah Blocks Enable Invites`.
